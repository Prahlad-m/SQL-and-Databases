## üß† Day 1 ‚Äì Database Concepts

### Task 1: Keys & Relationships

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- **Secondary Key**: Also uniquely identifies rows but isn‚Äôt the primary identifier.
- **Foreign Key**: Connects one table to another using the primary key from the referenced table.

**Examples of Relationships:**
- One-to-One: Each person ‚Üî National Insurance Number
- One-to-Many: One mother ‚Üî Many children
- Many-to-Many: Students ‚Üî Classes

### Task 2: Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

- **Relational**: Structured, schema-based (e.g., SQL databases)
- **Non-relational**: Schema-less, flexible for data like images, video, real-time feeds (e.g., NoSQL)
